For anyone doing a code review,

Create a new branch with your name followed by
"codeReview"

ex. sConboyCodeReview

Please use notepad, or any other application that can
create a .txt file. 

Once you've done so, add it to the
"code reviews" folder, and submit a pull request
so that I can look it over and add merge it in.

Please don't just put it in me.
