You have been tasked with building an application that will serve as a system for a company’s state database program. 

Your data must store all the states of the United States. 

It must store each state’s 
	name 
	population
	state flag description
	state flower
	state bird
	colors 
	the three largest cities
	capitol
	median income
	percentage of computer-related jobs offered 

Your software application should be able to insert all the data into a database, 
given some type of input medium. 

It must allow the user to select the state from a dropdown. 
It must then show the state details on a separate page. 

Furthermore, it must also be able to 
	
	search 		complete
	sort		complete
	update	 	complete
	filter 		complete
	
the data in all the columns for each state. 

Create a C# application that contains a database connection, 
a class library, and a windows forms project. 

Your program should be able to be run and be navigated, 
with clear instructions and proper error messages where applicable. 

Also, make sure to have the correct exception errors in case of bad input by the users.
